# Problem 2

In this session, we used list.files() with the “full.names argument” set to TRUE, as well as the basename() function to identify specific files. But what if you wanted a particular directory. Run list.files() with “full.names argument” and “recursive” argument set to TRUE, and then search online to find an R function that would retrieve the “” individual directory folders.

```{r}
list.files(path = "data", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
```

# List Individual directory folders (not files)

```{r}
list.dirs(path = ".", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r}
list
```
